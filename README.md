🔭 I’m currently working on improving my skills in game AI development, specifically focusing on pathfinding algorithms and behavior trees. I'm also exploring the potential of procedural generation techniques to create more dynamic and replayable game worlds.

🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 5 and expanding my knowledge of shaders and material creation. I'm also deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms to optimize game performance.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving multiplayer game development, particularly those incorporating innovative networking solutions or unique game mechanics.

🤔 I’m looking for help with optimizing my current project's performance on lower-end hardware. Any advice on efficient memory management and rendering techniques would be greatly appreciated.

💬 Ask me about my experience with Unity, C#, game design principles, or any aspect of game development. I'm always happy to share my knowledge and learn from others.
